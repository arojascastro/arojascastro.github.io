    "text": "Hello!\nI hold a PhD in Humanities from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain), where I wrote a dissertation on digital editing. During my PhD (2011–2015), I manually collated twenty witnesses of Luis de Góngora’s Soledades and encoded a critical text, which I published online using Edition Visualization Technology (EVT).\nFrom 2016 to 2019, I worked at the Cologne Center for eHumanities (CCeH) at the University of Cologne (Germany), focusing on the modeling, processing, and curation of letters and bibliographic references related to Albrecht von Haller—now published online as part of HallerNet.\nSince 2019, I have been working as a Digital Humanities researcher at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities for the Proyecto Humboldt Digital. In this role, I developed the Dossier Digital: Alexander von Humboldt and Cuba.\nIn addition, I serve as a Part-Time Lecturer at the Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR), where I teach a course on digital scholarly editing and supervise MA dissertations in the Digital Humanities program.\nBeyond research and teaching, I am committed to building a diverse and open academic community. I have volunteered in several organizations, including: - the European Association for Digital Humanities (2015–2018), - The Programming Historian en español (2016–2020), and - the Asociación de Humanidades Digitales Hispánicas (2021–2023)."
