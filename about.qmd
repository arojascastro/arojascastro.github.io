Hello!

I hold a **PhD in Humanities** from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain), where I wrote a dissertation on digital editing. During my PhD (2011–2015), I manually collated twenty witnesses of Luis de Góngora's *Soledades* and encoded a critical text, which I published online using Edition Visualization Technology (EVT).

From 2016 to 2019, I worked at the **Cologne Center for eHumanities (CCeH)** at the University of Cologne (Germany), focusing on the modeling, processing, and curation of letters and bibliographic references related to Albrecht von Haller—now published online as part of *HallerNet*.

Since 2019 to 2025, I worked as a Digital Humanities researcher at the **Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities** for the *Proyecto Humboldt Digital*. In this role, I developed the *Dossier Digital: Alexander von Humboldt and Cuba*.

I am currently working as Research Associate at the **Universität Tübingen**, where my research focuses on Calderón de la Barca's. Additonally, I am part of the team behind DraCor at the **Freie Universität Berlin** that aims to connect the platform with open science infrastructures and improve its impact. 

I also serve as a Part-Time Lecturer at the **Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR)**, where I teach a course on digital scholarly editing and supervise MA dissertations in the Digital Humanities program.

Beyond research and teaching, I am committed to building a diverse and open academic community. I have volunteered in several organizations, including:

* the European Association for Digital Humanities (2015–2018),
* *The Programming Historian en español* (2016–2020), and
* the Asociación de Humanidades Digitales Hispánicas (2021–2023).

In my free time I like doing sport, drawing, reading books, and discovering new places.
