title: "Teaching"
---

I have more than a decade of experience teaching in Digital Humanities, literary studies, and textual scholarship. Between 2020 and 2025, I served as a **Part-Time Lecturer at [Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR)](https://www.unir.net/)**, where I taught in the **Master’s Degree in Digital Humanities**. My teaching focused on **digital scholarly editing**, computational text analysis, and theoretical frameworks in the field. I also supervised numerous **Master’s theses** in both the Digital Humanities and Rhetoric and Public Speaking programs.

In addition to university teaching, I have led workshops and training sessions at institutions across Europe, including Università di Verona, Université Sorbonne, and NYU Abu Dhabi. These have focused on TEI/XML, digital editing, and the use of digital methods for analyzing and publishing cultural heritage materials.
